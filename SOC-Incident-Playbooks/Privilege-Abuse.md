## Overview  
When elevated permissions are misused—whether by a malicious insider or a stealthy attacker—the impact can be swift and devastating. This playbook offers a clear, human-centred process to detect, investigate, contain, and recover from privilege abuse incidents.

---

## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)  
- **Unusual Admin Logins:** Privileged accounts logging in at odd hours or from unfamiliar locations  
- **Unauthorized Account Changes:** Creation, elevation, or deletion of admin users without approved change requests  
- **ACL & Group Modifications:** Bulk changes to Active Directory groups or file-share permissions  
- **High-Risk Commands:** Execution of PowerShell (`Enable-PSRemoting`), `net user /add`, or similar admin tools

---

## Detection Techniques  
1. **SIEM Alerts**  
   - Trigger on out-of-hours or geographically inconsistent admin authentications.  
2. **Active Directory Auditing**  
   - Enable and review AccountManagement and DirectoryServices logs for all user- and group-change events.  
3. **Endpoint Monitoring**  
   - Watch for PowerShell or `cmd.exe` processes running under SYSTEM/Administrator contexts.  
4. **Session Recording Analysis**  
   - If sessions are recorded, scan for unusual commands, copy-paste events, or rapid context switches.

---

## Investigation Steps  
1. **Build a Timeline**  
   - Correlate SIEM, AD, and endpoint logs to map when and where privilege actions occurred.  
2. **Validate Authorization**  
   - Interview the account owner, their manager, or the change-control board to confirm legitimacy.  
3. **Assess Scope & Impact**  
   - List all resources accessed or modified by the privileged account during the incident window.  
4. **Cross-Reference Threat Intel**  
   - Compare observed behaviours against known credential compromise tactics (e.g., Golden Ticket attacks).

---

## Containment & Eradication  
- **Disable/Rotate Credentials**  
  Immediately deactivate affected accounts or rotate passwords and service keys.  
- **Revoke Unapproved Access**  
  Remove any unauthorized group memberships or ACL changes.  
- **Enforce Strong Controls**  
  Implement multi-factor authentication and just-in-time privilege elevation.  
- **Harden Admin Workstations**  
  Restrict network access, disable removable media, and apply least-privilege policies.

---

## Recovery  
- **Restore Correct Permissions**  
  Document and reapply proper access levels via your change-management system.  
- **Re-educate Stakeholders**  
  Conduct targeted training on request procedures and safe use of elevated rights.  
- **Refine Detection Rules**  
  Tune SIEM and AD alert thresholds to catch similar anomalies faster.  
- **Conduct Lessons-Learned Review**  
  Convene IT, security, and leadership teams to capture insights and update this playbook.
