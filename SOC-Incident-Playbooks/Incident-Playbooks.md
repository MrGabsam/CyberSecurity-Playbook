# Incident Response Playbooks by Gabriel Mumo Samuel

**Global Cybersecurity Expert | SOC Leader | AI in Security Innovator**

With over a decade of hands-on experience in Security Operations, threat hunting, and AI-driven defence strategies, I have authored and refined incident response methodologies that protect leading organisations worldwide. This repository demonstrates my mastery of technical detection, behavioural analysis, and policy designâ€”key pillars that underpin my application for the Global Talent Visa.

# Phishing Playbook

## Overview

A rigorous guide to detecting, investigating, and neutralising sophisticated phishing campaigns targeting users via email, SMS, or malicious links.

## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

* Spoofed or recently registered sender domains matching legitimate brands
* URLs where display text and actual link diverge
* Unexpected or obfuscated attachments (.exe, .js, .zip)
* Urgent or fear-inducing language ("Immediate action required...")

## Detection Techniques

1. **Email Header Forensics**: Analyse SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results for domain spoofing.
2. **Automated URL Sandboxing**: Run URLs in isolated environments to observe redirect and payload behaviour.
3. **Attachment Threat Intelligence**: Hash-based lookups against VirusTotal and proprietary intelligence feeds.
4. **User-Driven Reporting**: Integrated phishing submission workflows and feedback loops.

## Investigation Steps

1. Collect raw email headers and decode any encoded fields.
2. Extract and execute URLs/attachments in a sandbox; log network calls and system modifications.
3. Correlate SIEM events: DNS queries, web proxy logs, endpoint alerts.
4. Conduct structured interviews with affected users to reconstruct the attack timeline.

## Containment & Eradication

* **Block** suspicious domains/IPs at email gateway and DNS layers.
* **Quarantine** detected phishing emails and perform bulk deletion.
* **Reset** compromised credentials and enforce multi-factor authentication.
* **Update** awareness training and phishing simulation exercises.

## Recovery

* Monitor for resurgence of similar campaigns.
* Analyse gateway-filter metrics to confirm block efficacy.
* Refine email filtering rules based on new IOCs.
* Conduct post-incident review and share lessons learned with stakeholders.

# Malware Playbook

## Overview

Comprehensive procedures for detecting, responding to, and remediating malware infections on endpoints and servers.

## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

* Unauthorised process creation or DLL injection
* Sudden spikes in CPU/memory or network traffic
* Presence of known malicious file hashes or registry keys
* Alerts from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) platforms

## Detection Techniques

1. **EDR Telemetry**: Real-time monitoring of process and file behaviours.
2. **File Integrity Monitoring**: Hash-based tracking of critical system files.
3. **Network Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual data exfiltration or C2 communications.
4. **Host Forensics**: Analyse auto-start locations, scheduled tasks, and registry changes.

## Investigation Steps

1. **Isolate** suspected hosts to prevent lateral movement.
2. **Acquire** memory and disk images for detailed forensic analysis.
3. **Identify** malicious artefacts, persistence mechanisms, and C2 infrastructure.
4. **Trace** attacker actions using EDR logs and network captures.

## Containment & Eradication

* **Quarantine** or rebuild compromised machines.
* **Remove** malware samples and disable persistence.
* **Patch** exploited vulnerabilities and update signatures.
* **Deploy** updated YARA rules and EDR policies.

## Recovery

* **Reimage** systems from known good backups.
* **Validate** integrity of restored data and applications.
* **Conduct** infrastructure hardening and user briefings.
* **Review** incident post-mortem to strengthen controls.

# Privilege Abuse Playbook

## Overview

Best practices for detecting and mitigating misuse of elevated permissions by insiders or external attackers.

## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

* Out-of-hours administrative logins from unfamiliar IPs
* Creation or elevation of privileged accounts without change requests
* Bulk modifications to access control lists (ACLs)
* Execution of sensitive commands (e.g., `net user /add`, `Enable-PSRemoting`)

## Detection Techniques

1. **SIEM Rules**: Alert on atypical admin logins by time, geography, or device.
2. **AD Audit Logs**: Monitor AccountManagement events for account creation and group changes.
3. **Endpoint Process Monitoring**: Track PowerShell and `cmd.exe` usage with high privileges.
4. **Session Recording**: Review recordings of privileged sessions (if available).

## Investigation Steps

1. **Identify** the source of privileged actions (user, host, time).
2. **Audit** all recent changes to user accounts and group memberships.
3. **Interview** the user or stakeholder to validate legitimacy.
4. **Cross-reference** with threat intelligence on compromised credentials.

## Containment & Eradication

* **Disable/Rotate** compromised credentials immediately.
* **Revoke** unauthorized group memberships.
* **Enforce** MFA and just-in-time privileged access controls.
* **Harden** administrative hosts with least-privilege policies.

## Recovery

* **Restore** correct permission sets and document changes.
* **Train** users on policy and approval workflows for admin tasks.
* **Tune** detection rules to reduce false positives and catch anomalies early.

# Additional Playbooks

* **Data Exfiltration**: Monitor large-scale data transfers, anomalous SMB or FTP activity, DLP policy violations.
* **Insider Threat**: Baseline normal user behaviours, detect abrupt deviations, and intervene with user outreach.
* **Credential Stuffing**: Detect rapid login failures, monitor IP reputation, implement lockouts and CAPTCHAs.
* **Ransomware Response**: Validate backup integrity, isolate encryption sources, engage decryption solutions, and negotiate where necessary.
